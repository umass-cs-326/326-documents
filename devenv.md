## Overview

This course uses a number of tools for software development. Each of these tools are described below. If there is something that you need to do, you will notice a **TODO** for that tool. You should complete the TODO before you can move on to the next tool. You will need to sign up or install each of the tools below before you can attempt an assignment.

## Git Version Control

This course uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control extensively. Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to files and to keep track of the history of those changes. It is an important tool for working with code and is used heavily in the real world. In this course, you will learn how to use Git to manage your code by using it for every assignment and project. If you are unfamiliar with Git, do not worry! It is not a difficult tool to learn, but it does require some practice.

**TODO:**

- You will need to download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your platform to be prepared for this course.

## GitHub

All the code repositories that you will be working on are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You will need to create an account on GitHub to be able to complete assignments in this course.

**TODO:**

- [Sign up](https://github.com/signup) for an account on GitHub.

## GitHub Classroom

[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) is used in this course for assignment submissions. It is a free service that allows us to create and manage GitHub repositories for student assignments. When an assignment is released, you will click on a link which will automatically create a repository for you.

You do not need to do anything to be able to use GitHub Classroom. We will automatically add you to the system by linking it with the Moodle.

## Visual Student Code (VSCode)

VSCode is a free, open-source code editor for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is used in this course to write code for your assignments. We also use it in many of the code demonstrations. We highly recommend that you use this code editor as it provides a lot of features that making coding a wonderful experience!

**TODO:**

- You will need to download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your platform to be prepared for this course.
