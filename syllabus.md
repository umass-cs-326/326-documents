# COMPSCI 326 Web Programming

## Syllabus / Summer 2022

**General Information**

- Dates: 5/19 - 7/1
- Instructor: Tim Richards

---

## Course Overview

The web is arguably today’s most important application platform. Web browsers run on practically every device, and even many phone applications are in fact web applications under the covers. This course will cover a broad range of client-side web technologies, including HTTP itself, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript; it will additionally cover key concepts for the server side of web applications, including key value stores and SQL servers. This course will also cover key concepts and technologies including AJAX, JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery), and web security. This course is hands-on and heavily project-based; students will construct a substantial dynamic web application based on the concepts, technologies, and techniques presented during lectures and in readings. This course satisfies the IE Requirement.

## Prerequisites

COMPSCI 220 (or 230) with a grade of C or better, or INFO 248 and COMPSCI 186/187, with a grade of C or better in each. This course assumes a good understanding of programming at the 187 (data structure implementation) or 186 level (using data structures), basic command line usage, understanding of version control systems (e.g., git), and object-oriented programming concepts and techniques are helpful. Previous JavaScript background, while not required, is also helpful. We also assume a level of maturity for success in working in a team-based environment.

## Required Text

No required text. All material will be provided through lectures notes, slides, examples, code, and any other resources deemed as relevant to the topics covered in this course.

## Course Development Environment

Given that this is a programming intensive course, it is important to highlight the development environment! Generally, most of what we cover in this course is available on all the typical operating systems. However, the team project allows you to explore additional environments that may have specific OS requirements. You are welcome to use those additional libraries/tools; however, you will not receive direct support for what you decide to use. It is your responsibility for the installation, setup, and use of those additional components. You are welcome to use any editor, IDE, or tools to explore this material. We strongly recommend that you use Visual Studio Code.

## Learning Outcomes

After this course, students will be able to:

- Apply HTML to structure content rendered in a browser
- Apply CSS to style content in a browser to enhance the usability of an application
- Apply the JavaScript programming language to solve problems in a web environment
- Apply the fundamental architecture of a front-end web application
- Apply the fundamental architecture of a back-end web application
- Apply the connection between front-end and back-end
- Apply a RESTful web application
- Apply the fundamental construction of a modern and complete web application

## Integrative Experience

This course satisfies the Integrative Experience (IE) requirement. The upper-division integrative experience provides a structured context for students to reflect on their own learning and explore the connections between the broad exposure provided by General Education and the more focused exposure of their major. You can read additional details on the integrative experience website. The IE requirement is fulfilled by this course through the application of extensive team-based learning. Furthermore, this course embraces the IE through a substantial team project that is entirely student driven and explicitly integrates the material covered in this course with the experiences, learning, and knowledge attained by every unique person enrolled in this course.

## Course Format

Weekly Format The course is organized into weeks where each week contains material to be reviewed and assignments to be completed. The material for the week will be released early enough to get a head start if you complete the material for the previous week. However, some material (e.g., homework) is only released after previous work has been completed and a solution is posted. The weekly schedule will be clearly visible in Moodle.

## Rules for Success

### Student Responsibilities

If you follow these rules, your odds of learning the material and achieving a good grade in this course will improve greatly.

- Read the assignment documentation early and carefully.
- Do your work on time, submit your work on time, and make sure you submitted the correct work.
- Communicate with other students in the course, the professor, and other course staff for help.
- Be honest in the work you do and the submissions you make.
- Communicate with me and others in the course with respect and understanding.
- Do not ask to submit assignments after the due date.

## Instructor Responsibilities

You can expect from us:

- Timely release of course assignments.
- Timely release of scores achieved on course assignments.
- To respond to questions in the discussion forums in a reasonable amount of time during the week and normal working hours.
- Be respectful of your ideas and value the diversity you bring to the virtual classroom.
- Be open to dialogue that challenges me.
- Be present during my stated office hours.
- Ensure the proper running of the course.

## Grading Policy

The anticipated breakdown of course grades is as follows; this is subject to change.

- In-Class Exercises (5%)
- Labs (5%)
- Homework (50%)
- Project (40%)

## Grading Notes

- The numerical cutoff for final course letter grade assignment will be made after all grading is completed. As a rough guide, expect to require at least a 93 to get an A, a 90 to get an A-, an 87 to get a B+, an 83 to get a B, an 80 to get a B-, etc.
- Individual projects/assignments/labs will not be scaled (curved).
- The instructor may or may not choose to scale final grades.
- Final grades are assigned based on the overall weighted average as defined by the grading policy. Grades will be rounded up. For example, if you achieve an 89.93 then the final letter grade will be (for example) an A-, not a B+.

## Assignments

- **Participation**: Things that are part of an assignment. This might be surveys or other questions that arise. (TODO: add more details)

- **Exercises**: Small activities designed to be completed before a homework is attempted. (TODO: add more details)

- **Homework**: individual programming assignments that reinforce material taught in class. These are one-week long assignments. They require you to apply your understanding of the material to a programming challenge that emphasizes what you have learned during lecture and any assigned material.

- **Project**: The team project encompasses the last third of the semester - approximately 4 weeks. You will be required to work in a team of 3-4 students to design and implement a web application using the three important components of web applications including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design and implementation of the application is entirely up to you, but it must solve a real-world problem, be connected to work you have done in other areas (general education), connect to your discipline (e.g., CS, Informatics) and be relatively unique as compared to other existing applications (within reason). You are expected to not use any frameworks beyond Bootstrap; other libraries are allowed only with prior consent of the professor.

## Assignment Submission

Assignments will be submitted electronically. You are responsible for submitting your assignments by the assigned due date. The due dates for assignments will be clearly indicated on the schedule and it is your responsibility to update your own calendar, so you are aware of due dates.

### Late and Early Submissions

(TODO: fix this section)

### Lateness General Guidelines

Lateness is defined as any assignment that is outside of the stated due date requirements. We allow assignments to be submitted three days “late” after the posted due date. However, penalties might be applied. After the three days we will not accept a submission from any assessment component. It is your responsibility for maintaining your own schedule and being prompt with your submissions. We expect that you become familiar with the course submission software and verify that your submission has been properly uploaded. We will not accept late submissions due to lack of checking on this. We assume:

- You are an adult and can check and verify your work has been received properly.
- You can use GitHub, DropBox, Google Drive, or some other backup software to ensure that your work is not lost in the event of a computer failure.
- You have a back-up plan in place in the event that your computer fails, or your internet connection is unavailable. Make sure you have a plan B and C if your computer crashes or your internet is unavailable. This is your responsibility.
- To ensure that you submit projects on time you should begin them early and not wait until the last minute to submit. You will be able to submit multiple times so submit early and often to ensure you have something in before the deadline.

If there are extenuating circumstances beyond your control that prevent you from completing an assignment by the posted deadline you must contact the instructor immediately using the appropriate communication mechanism (see Communication below).

## Final Grades

To evaluate your understanding of the course content, we will use scores achieved on each of the above assessment components. Your final grade will convey what you know from the course and how well you know it. Missing assignments can have a dramatic impact on your final grade so it is important that you are attentive to submission deadlines and avoid any missing work. The typical breakdown of percentages and final grades for this course are A (93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (60-66), F (0-59). This grading scheme may be adjusted based on the overall performance of students in the course.

## Communication

- Email
- Moodle
- Piazza

We will be using Piazza for all communication. The discussion forum should be your first choice for asking questions as others most certainly have the same question. You should check the discussion forum before asking your question to see if the same question has already been posted. We will not answer questions that have already been answered in the discussion forum. Think before you post. We expect you to do a reasonable amount of thinking to try to solve your problems before posting for help. Make sure you are articulate and clear with your post (i.e., think before you post). You should post questions related to assignments early rather than wait until the last minute. Questions that are posted very near an assignment deadline may not be answered. Course staff are expected to answer questions Monday through Friday. Do not expect prompt answers on Saturday, Sunday, and scheduled holidays and breaks. Do not send direct email to course staff unless it is an emergency (death or extreme documented illness).

Please post with respect and kindness. Posts that are disrespectful, crude, inappropriate, or mean will not be tolerated and will be reported and result in your immediate removal from the course and a failure for the course.

## Equality Statement

The course staff is dedicated to establishing a learning environment that promotes diversity of the students, including race, class, culture, religion, gender, sexual identity, and physical ability. It is important that this is a safe in-person and virtual classroom environment. We will practice being generous and respectful members of our classroom and computer science community. Anyone noticing discriminatory behavior in this class, or who feels discriminated against, should bring it to the attention of the professor immediately.

## Course Support

**Office Hours**: Additional time that we provide real-time access to the instructor, TAs, and UCAs. You do not need an appointment to attend office hours, attendance is optional, and all questions you have about the course are welcome. These sessions will be held at several different times during the week. Office hours will be posted on the course website.

## Accommodations

The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing an equal educational opportunity for all students. If you have a documented physical, psychological, or learning disability on file with Disability Services (DS), you may be eligible for reasonable academic accommodations to help you succeed in this course. If you have a documented disability that requires an accommodation, please notify me as soon as possible so that we may make appropriate arrangements. For further information, please visit Disability Services (https://www.umass.edu/disability/).

## Title IX

If you have been the victim of sexual violence, gender discrimination, or sexual harassment, the university can provide you with a variety of support resources and accommodations. UMass is committed to providing these resources with minimal impact and costs to survivors on a case-by-case basis. Resources are available to survivors with or without them filing a complaint. No upfront costs are charged to any currently enrolled students for University Health Services or the Center for Counseling and Psychological Health, and no fees exist for services in the Dean of Students Office, the Center for Women and Community, Student Legal Services, or by live-in residential staff.

## Attendance and Participation

This is an online asynchronous course. However, we do encourage you to participate in asking questions and contributing towards answering to other student questions.

## Course Incompletes

Students who are unable to complete course requirements within the allotted time because of severe medical or personal problems only may request a grade of Incomplete from the instructor of the course. Incomplete grades are warranted only if a student is passing the course at the time of the request and if the course requirements can be completed by the end of the following semester. Furthermore, an incomplete will be granted if at least 75% of the work has been completed for the course. Otherwise, the recommended course of action is to withdraw and retake the course in the future. Please see the Academic Regulations Section IV Grading System and Credit Guidelines for further details.

**_Note: an incomplete means you are on your own to complete the material agreed upon by the instructor of this course. Do not expect additional help or one-on-one teaching of the material past the course completion date. It is your responsibility to complete the remaining material._**

## Academic Honesty

Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic honesty is required of all students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the University. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. Since students are expected to be [familiar with this policy](http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/) and the commonly accepted standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent.

### Overview

It is very important in all courses that you be honest in all the work that you complete. In this course, you must complete all assignments, quizzes, exams, etc. on your own unless otherwise specified. If you do not, you are doing a disservice to yourself, the instructors for the course, the College of Information and Computer Sciences, the University of Massachusetts, and your future. We design our courses to provide you the necessary understanding and skill that will make you an excellent computer scientist. Assignments and exams are designed to test your knowledge and understanding of the material. Plagiarism and academic honesty of any sort may seem like an easy way to solve an immediate problem (which it is not), however, it can have a substantial negative impact on your career as a computer science student. There are many computing jobs out there and many more people working hard to get those positions. If you do not know your stuff you will have a very difficult time finding a job. Please take this seriously.

We will carefully review your submissions automatically and manually to verify that “cheating” has not taken place. If you are suspected of plagiarism we will follow an informal path to determine if academic dishonesty has taken place. If you are found guilty you will receive an F for the course and it will go on your permanent record at UMass. This will disrupt your schedule for completing courses and may lead to you not completing your degree in a timely fashion. You should carefully review the Academic Honesty Policy, Avoiding Plagiarism, and the Academic Honesty Flowchart to understand what academic honesty is, how you can avoid it, and the procedure we will follow if you are under suspicion. In general, you should review all documentation described by UMass’ Academic Honesty Policy and Procedures.

**Specifics for this course:**

- Unless otherwise specified, assignments in this course are individual, not group, and direct collaboration is inappropriate. Any group work we will clearly mark as such.
- While we support learning from your peers, the rule of thumb is that any learning will be in your head. Therefore, you should not leave an encounter (in person or electronic) with anything written down (or electronically recorded) that you did not have before. Thus, giving or receiving electronic files is specifically considered cheating.
- Use of materials from previous offerings of this course, no matter the source and even if you are retaking the course, is prohibited.
- We will employ various means, electronic and otherwise, to check for compliance with these course policies. We will pursue sanctions vigorously and the usual sanction we will pursue is an F in the course.
